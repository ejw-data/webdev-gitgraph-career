## Overview  

This repo demonstrates how gitgraph.js can be used to create a custom diagram.  The library is very versatile but in the scenario that I am applying this technology may be too detailed and a simpler block diagram might work better.  Even if that is true, I still am impressed with this library and the potential it has for building git diagrams on websites dynamically.  

## Technology  
Javascript, gitgraph.js
